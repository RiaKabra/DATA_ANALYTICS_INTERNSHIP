# DATA_ANALYTICS_INTERNSHIP
 I worked as a Data Analytics Intern at Apexon, Hyderabad from AUgust 2023- November 2023.
 I worked on labelling GitHub issues into bug, feature and requests
 This was done in two parts - 
 1) Part 1: Data Engineering (cleaning and transformation of data)
 2) Part 2: ML (built the model using NLP and classifiers to accurately catgeorize the issues)
